      ## Rationale
      ## Rationale for Proposed Architecture

The architecture proposed leverages cloud-native patterns and components suitable for modernizing a legacy application in the finance industry. The following decisions were made:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Transitioning from a monolithic structure to microservices allows for independent scaling, ease of deployment, and flexibility in technology choices. Each service (Portfolio, Transaction, Reporting) can evolve independently, reducing the reliance on a single codebase.
2. **AWS Services**: Utilizing AWS, such as EC2 for compute and RDS for database solutions, ensures high availability, scalability, and managed services that reduce operational overhead.
3. **Kubernetes**: By deploying microservices on Kubernetes, we enable container orchestration, improving resource utilization and scalability during peak workloads.
4. **Observability**: Implementing modern logging and monitoring solutions (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) enhances the observability of the application, allowing for real-time performance insights and quick issue resolution.
5. **Security**: Utilizing IAM roles and established security groups ensures least privilege access, aligning with compliance requirements in the finance industry.

Overall, this modern architecture will reduce operational risk, lower maintenance costs, enhance feature delivery speed, and improve customer satisfaction. Additionally, the cloud environment aligns with evolving regulatory standards, providing flexibility and scalability.

      ## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
      # Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Problem(s) to Solve
The existing COBOL-based application is monolithic, resulting in performance bottlenecks, high maintenance costs, and challenges in integrating with modern technologies. It lacks scalability, observability, and compliance functionalities, leading to reduced customer satisfaction.

## Analysis Performed
Conducted a thorough assessment of the current architecture's limitations in supporting business functions and the need for modernization to meet evolving customer demands and regulatory standards. Reviewed cloud-native resources and best practices suitable for the finance industry.

## Decision and Justification
Adopted a microservices architecture on AWS, incorporating container orchestration with Kubernetes, RDS for database management, and enhanced security features. This decision is justified by the anticipated improvements in scalability, reduced operational costs, better compliance, increased ability to innovate, and overall enhanced customer experience.
